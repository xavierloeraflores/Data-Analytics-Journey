## Career Plan

### Career 1: Business Intelligence Analyst

Business intelligence analysts are responsible for using data to help businesses make daily decisions. They gather key business datasets such as revenue, sales, or market trends to visualize data for key stakeholders within the company. They support the data analytics life cycle by providing insights and recommendations to improve business processes especially in the Business Understanding and Reporting & Visualization phases.

### Career 2: Data Engineer

Data engineers design, build, and maintain the data infrastructure or pipelines for processing, storage, and retrieval. They maintain data pipelines with accurate clean data from various sources. Data engineers support the Data Acquisition, Data Cleaning, and Data Exploration phases of the data analytics life cycle.

### Career 3: Machine Learning Engineer

Machine learning engineers handle the design, development, and deployment of machine learning models that solve complex business problems. Machine learning engineers will select, train, and evaluate models to predict future outcomes or classify data. They support the Predictive Modeling and Data Mining & Machine Learning phases of the data analytics life cycle.

### Comparison

While all three career paths are related to data analytics, they focus on and provide different types of support to the data analytics life cycle. Business intelligence analysts focus on the Business Understanding and Reporting & Visualization phases, data engineers focus on the Data Acquisition, Data Cleaning, and Data Exploration phases, and machine learning engineers focus on the Predictive Modeling and Data Mining & Machine Learning phases. Each of their skill sets and responsibilities are unique and essential to their area of the data analytics life cycle.

## Potential Career Goal

As a student pursuing an MSDA with a specialization in data science with an extensive background in software engineering, I am interested in pursuing a career as a machine learning engineer. This career path aligns with my strong foundation in programming, mathematics, and statistics, as well as my passion for solving complex business problems.

### CliftonStrengths Reflection

My top five CliftonStrengths themes are Restorative, Ideation, Relator, Analytical, and Intellection. My Ideation, Analytical, and Intellection themes fall under the strategic thinking leadership domain allowing me to absorb and analyze information to make strategic decisions. My Restorative theme falls under the executing leadership domain signalling that my drive to find answers helps me make actionable decisions. My Relator theme falls under the relationship-building leadership domain indicating that I can build strong relationships by connecting deeply with the right people. These themes are crucial for a machine learning engineer as they require strategic thinking and problem-solving skills to develop machine learning models.
